==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::TextTemplate - Posy plugin for interpolating with
Text::Template


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::TextTemplate.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This overrides Posy's simple interpolate() method, by using the
Text::Template module. This is *not* compatible with core Posy style
interpolation.

Note that, if you want access to any of posy's methods inside a template,
the Posy object should be available through the variable "$Posy".


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``tt_recurse_into_entry''
Do you want me to recursively interpolate into the entry $title and $body?
Consider carefully before turning this on, since if anyone other than you
has the ability to post entries, there is a chance of foolishness or malice,
exposing variables and calling actions/subroutines you might not want
called. (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

``tt_left_delim'' ``tt_right_delim''
The delimiters to use for Text::Template; for the sake of speed, it is best
not to use the original '{' '}' delimiters. (default: tt_left_delim='[==',
tt_right_delim='==]')

``tt_entry_left_delim'' ``tt_entry_right_delim''
The delimiters to use for Text::Template inside an entry (if
tt_recurse_into_entry is true) (default: tt_entry_left_delim='<?perl'
tt_entry_right_delim='perl?>')

I used these defaults because they look like XML directives, and for
compatibility with teperl.
